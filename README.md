This is my website, blog, and portfolio. I designed and built it myself using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and MDX. For more information on the tech stack, see [my initial blog post](https://nickoates.com/blog/rebuilding-my-website). Parts of the design were inspired by [Lee Robinson's website](https://leerob.io) and [Apple's newsroom](https://www.apple.com/newsroom).
