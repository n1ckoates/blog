It seems like every few months, I rebuild my website. I don't blog nearly enough to warrant that, but I enjoy iterating and improving on the design and functionality regardless. It's nice to have your own place on the internet, free of algorithms and outside control, and I'm glad to have the skills to build my own.

This time around, I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev). I used the first two technologies for my last website, but had my own content system using [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark). Contentlayer made it way easier to manage and render blog posts, and I'm happy with the results. As always, Next.js and Tailwind provided incredible developer experience (dare I say the **best** on the market), and made it easy to build a fast, responsive, and accessible website. I deployed the whole thing on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), which allows me to iterate quickly on a generous free tier.

This website has been in development for a long time. I sat on the project for months, but I'm glad I finally got around to finishing and releasing it. I'm excited to share the details of the project, and I hope you enjoy the new website! If you'd like to take a look at the source code, it's available [on GitHub](https://github.com/n1ckoates/blog).
