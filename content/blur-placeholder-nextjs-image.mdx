When users visit my blog, I don't want them to see an empty space while an image loads. Instead, I want to show a blurred, low-quality version of the image as a placeholder. This is a common technique used by many websites, and [Next.js' Image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image) has built-in support for these placeholders.

My blog uses [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) to render MDX files into React components. This library allows me to map HTML tags to React components, which lets me replace `img` with a `CustomImage` component.

```jsx
<MDXRemote
	source="![An image](https://example.com/image.jpg)"
	components={{ img: CustomImage }}
/>
```

The `CustomImage` component receives the regular `img` props, and uses `sharp` to generate a low-quality version of the image. Sharp is also used to get the width and height of the image, which is required by the `next/image` component to [prevent layout shifts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#image-sizing). Then, the low-quality image is converted to a base64 string and passed to the `next/image` component as the `blurDataURL` prop.

```jsx
import Image from "next/image";
import sharp from "sharp";

async function CustomImage(props) {
	const sharpImage = sharp(path.join(process.cwd(), "public", props.src)); // Get image path
	const { width, height } = await sharpImage.metadata(); // Get image dimensions

	const placeholder = await sharpImage.resize(10).toBuffer(); // Resize to 10px wide
	const base64 = placeholder.toString("base64"); // Convert to base64 string
	const blurDataURL = `data:image/png;base64,${base64}`; // Prepend data URL

	return (
		<Image
			{...props} // Pass through original props, e.g. `alt`
			placeholder="blur"
			blurDataURL={blurDataURL}
			width={width}
			height={height}
			className="rounded-lg drop-shadow-sm"
			sizes="(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px"
		/>
	);
}
```

It's also useful to add styles and other props to the base `next/image` component -- I've added a border radius and drop shadow, and set the `sizes` prop to prevent the image from being larger than the viewport.
